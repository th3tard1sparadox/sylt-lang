= Sylt

Sylt is a statically checked and dynamically typed programming language made
for game jams. Working in Sylt should be a pain- and fearless experience. If it
isn't, please file an
https://github.com/FredTheDino/sylt-lang/issues/new/choose[issue].

Everyone likes example code, so here is some:

[source, sylt]
----
start :: fn do              // <1>
    print("Hello, world!")  // <2>
end
----

<1> Define the program entry point
<2> Do the thing
